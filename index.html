<p>The point guard is usually the playmaker of the team and also the smallest but in recent times, point guards have became the teams main scorer with players like Stephen Curry, Russell Westrbrook and Kyrie Irving topping the league in points per game the last few seasons.Shooting guards are usually the number one shooter on their team and their main job is to try to find open space so the playmaker and pass to them.  </p>
